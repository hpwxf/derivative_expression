An **experimental** expression parser using PEGTL.

Once the expression parsed, it can evaluate the expression and compute its symbolic derivatives.

Extensible but not (yet) very efficient.

The code coverage is quiet good (~90%) and computations are right.
It will be the base for a large refactoring for performance imporvement and expression simplicitations.
